A fun, interactive console-based game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game limits players to 5 attempts, adding a challenging twist!

## Steps:

1- Create a git repository

2- Add your empty project into git

3- Create the app and push it 

## Features

- Randomly generated number within a set range (e.g., 1 to 100)
- **5 attempts** to guess the correct number
- Hints provided after each guess ("Too high" or "Too low")

## How to Play

1. **Run the program** in your console or preferred IDE.
2. **Enter a number** when prompted to make your guess.
3. **Receive feedback**: The program will tell you if your guess is too high or too low.
4. **Continue guessing** until you either guess correctly or use up all 5 attempts.
5. **End of Game**: If you guess correctly, you win! If you run out of attempts, the correct answer will be revealed.

## Example Gameplay

```plaintext
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!
I've picked a number between 1 and 100. You have 5 attempts to guess it.

Attempt 1: Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.

Attempt 2: Enter your guess: 25
Too low! Try again.

Attempt 3: Enter your guess: 37
Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number!

OR

Attempt 5: Enter your guess: 42
Sorry, you've used all 5 attempts. The correct number was 37.
```
